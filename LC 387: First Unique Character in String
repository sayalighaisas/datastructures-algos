Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return it's index. If it doesn't exist, return -1.

Examples:

s = "leetcode"
return 0.

s = "loveleetcode",
return 2.
Note: You may assume the string contain only lowercase letters.

class Solution(object):
    def firstUniqChar(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        strmap={}
        for i in s:
            if i in strmap:
                strmap[i]+=1
            else:
                strmap[i]=1
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if strmap[s[i]]==1:
                return i
        return -1
